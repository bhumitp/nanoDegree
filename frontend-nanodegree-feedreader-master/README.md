# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## Instructions
1. Download all the necessary files for the Project.
2. Open the index.html file in any browser.
3. Run the jasmine test suite at the bottom of browser (if needed).
4. To add more test cases - contribute to feedreader.js file in the jasmine folder.
