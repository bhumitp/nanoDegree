## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

### Instructions

To view the portfolio website, download all the necessary files and open the index.html in your browser.

To view the pizza website, download all the necessary files and open the pizza.html in your browser.

#### Optimizations
I moved the document.get requests out of the for loops so that it prevents the browser from rendering page everytime.

Created variables outside the for loop so they can be used globally.

After researching on querySelector vs getElementById vs getElementsByClassName, I decided not to use querySelector as it slows down the performance [http://ryanmorr.com/abstract-away-the-performance-faults-of-queryselectorall/]

I also optimized one of the pizzeria image
Also added a dynamic way to calculate number of pizza which was hard coded first.
